I am a big fan of Chinese Poems (唐诗宋词). My favoriate poets are Bai Li (李白), Shi Su (苏轼), Qiji Xin (辛弃疾), Qingzhao Li (李清照), etc. I started to learn poems from my age 3 and write my own poems since junior high school.

The following poems are created by me in Chinese:

**星夜旅**

星夜驰车旅，似雨又非雨。

电龙如白昼，惊断行人语。
