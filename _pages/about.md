I am a first-year Ph.D. student of computer science at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/). My advisor is [Dr. Jennie Rogers](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jennie/).

My research interests focus on privacy and security of computer science including secure query processing/optimization, privacy-preserving machine learning, etc.

I received my M.S. in Computer Science at [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) in 2020 and my B.S. in computer science at [University of California, San Diego] (https://cse.ucsd.edu) in 2016.
