I am a first-year Ph.D. student of computer science at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/). My advisor is [Dr. Jennie Rogers](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jennie/).

My research interests focus on privacy and security of computer science including secure query processing/optimization, privacy-preserving machine learning, etc.

I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) in 2020 advised by [Dr. Martine De Cock](http://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/) and my B.S. in computer science from [University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu) in 2016. After graduating from UCSD, I worked for Watson IoT@[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) as a data scientist at Beijing, China.
