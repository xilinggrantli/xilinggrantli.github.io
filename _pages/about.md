I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at [Northwestern University](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/people/phd-students/l-r.html) advised by [Dr. Jennie Rogers](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jennie/). *I am looking for a post-doc position starting from 2027.*

Broadly speaking, my research interests focus on security, privacy and trustworthiness of data management and applications including verifiable query evaluation (DB), privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) and so on. Meanwhile, I have extensive experience working with [secure multi-party computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation), [zero knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) and [differential privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy).

I received my M.S. degree in Computer Science from [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) in 2020 advised by [Dr. Martine De Cock](http://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/) and my B.S. degree in computer science from [University of California, San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu) in 2016. During gap years between UCSD and UW, I worked for Watson IoT at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/) as a data scientist at Beijing, China.

I would welcome any inquiries regarding my research. Please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:xiling.li@northwestern.edu) if you're interested.
