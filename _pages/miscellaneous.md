## **Motto**

> *In research, you may be working alone on a problem for years without a clue of whether it is solvable.* <br /> From [Mor Harchol-Balter, CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)

## **To new PhD student**

> It is ok to be confused at your first year. You may like a boat floating on the sea and have no idea where to go. Your advisor will be your captain to show the way. Eventually, you will be your own captain and head to your own destination.
